## Overview

This document, authored by ASPPIBRA-DAO, addresses the digital world of real estate registration. It aims to offer a solution for Urban and Rural Land Regularization in Brazil. This solution seeks to ensure the digital inclusion of all property owners and possessors throughout the country. The project complies with LAW No. 13,465, OF JULY 11, 2017, which deals with urban and rural land regularization. The solution utilizes blockchain technology to scale real estate registration on a global scale. It addresses issues related to informality and transparency in property registration, ultimately providing access to inviolable decentralized information. Notably, the document mentions the creation of a unique NFT representing ownership of a house.
